# Momentum Calculator (Python)

This project is a simple Python program that calculates the **momentum of an object** using basic physics.

Momentum is calculated using the formula:

p = m × v

Where:
- m = mass of the object (in kilograms)
- v = velocity of the object (in meters per second)

## 📌 Features
- Takes user input for mass and velocity
- Calculates momentum accurately
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- Well-structured and easy to understand

---

## 🧮 Formula Used
Momentum (p) = Mass (m) × Velocity (v)

Unit of momentum: **kg·m/s**
